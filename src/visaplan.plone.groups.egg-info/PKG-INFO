        Extended groups management for Plone
        
        This package contains some additional groups management pages and a simple
        feature for scheduled activation and termination of group memberships,
        using a few tables in a PostgreSQL database
        (with currently hardcoded names).
        
        The purpose of this package (for now) is *not* to provide new functionality
        but to factor out existing functionality from an existing monolitic Zope product.
        Thus, it is more likely to lose functionality during further development
        (as parts of it will be forked out into their own packages,
        or some functionality may even become obsolete because there are better
        alternatives in standard Plone components).
        
        The additional fields for groups are not (yet) part of this package.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        1.0.2 (2019-05-13)
        ------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Fixed incomplete conversion of Tomcom adapters usage to ``getToolByName``
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2019-05-09)
        ------------------
        
        Note: Due to a regression, please proceed to version 1.0.2!
        
        - New functions ``utils.generate_{structure,course}_group_ids``,
          ``generate_structure_group_tuples``
        
        - Support for option ``resolve_role`` for the following functions:
        
          - ``split_group_id``
          - ``generate_structure_group_tuples``
        
          With ``resolve_role=True``, these functions tell a role a role, and a
          suffix a suffix; e.g., the ``Author`` group of structures is not given the
          ``Author`` but the ``Editor`` local role.
        
          For now, the default value for ``resolve_role`` is *False*;
          this may change in future versions.
